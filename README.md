# üîç File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) on Windows & Linux

This project demonstrates how to implement a **File Integrity Monitoring** (FIM) system on both Windows and Linux using native scripting. It helps detect unauthorized file changes and supports basic real-time alerting and forensic investigation ‚Äî especially useful for personal labs and lightweight endpoint monitoring.

---

## üìå Project Objective

- Track file modifications (creation, alteration, deletion) in critical directories.
- Maintain historical integrity via hash comparisons.
- Log suspicious changes for audit or further analysis.
- Practice log collection, automation, and response scripting.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **PowerShell** ‚Äì for monitoring in Windows
- **Bash / Cron** ‚Äì for Linux systems
- **Event Viewer** (Windows) / **Syslog** (Linux)
- Optional: **Splunk**, **ELK Stack**, or any SIEM for centralized logging and analysis

## ü™ü File Monitoring on Windows

### üîß Setup

1. Place the `monitor.ps1` script under `C:\FIM\` or your preferred directory.
2. Use **Task Scheduler** to run the script periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes).
3. Ensure script execution policy is set to allow:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

## üìä Sample Output

The PowerShell script logs any changes (creation, modification, deletion) to the files in the specified directory. Below is an example of what the log file (`file_change_log.txt`) might look like after running the script.

### Sample Log Output:

<!-- ‚Ä¶ ```text
[2025-04-22 14:31:12] Modified: C:\Users\Public\Documents\plan.docx
[2025-04-22 14:35:01] Created: C:\Users\Public\Documents\newfile.txt
[2025-04-22 14:45:30] Deleted: C:\Users\Public\Documents\oldfile.txt
``` -->

### Key Points:
- This section explains the sample log output format that gets generated by the script.
- The log includes timestamps, file actions (modified, created, deleted), and file paths.
- You can link to or upload a screenshot showing the actual log output on your local system or in a virtual environment.

## üß† Key Learnings

- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Implemented file monitoring on Windows using PowerShell and Linux using Bash, focusing on real-time detection of file changes like creation, modification, and deletion.

- **Hashing for Integrity**: Used SHA-256 hashing to detect unauthorized file changes, ensuring data integrity and providing a secure mechanism to verify file states.

- **Automation**: Automated the file monitoring process with PowerShell scripts and scheduled them to run periodically via Windows Task Scheduler, ensuring continuous monitoring.

- **Cross-Platform Application**: Gained experience applying the same file integrity monitoring techniques on both Windows and Linux platforms, using platform-specific tools like PowerShell and Bash.

- **Log Management**: Learned to capture and analyze file change logs, which can be used for security auditing and identifying suspicious activity.

- **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Set up a system that logs and alerts on file changes, improving proactive security and threat detection capabilities.

- **Problem-Solving**: Overcame configuration and troubleshooting challenges, such as file path issues and task scheduling, strengthening my troubleshooting skills.

This project not only solidified my understanding of **file integrity monitoring** but also sharpened my skills in **scripting**, **automation**, and **log analysis**, all of which are essential for any cybersecurity professional.
